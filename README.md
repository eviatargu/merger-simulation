# Merger Simulation
These two examples show how to implement merger simulation in R.  
Merger simulation can be done after estimating demand parameters with demand estimation
or with calibrating assumed demand parameters.   
  

These examples focus on the computational part - the algebra used to solve the 
structural model and the fixed point iteration algorithm. 

To calculate the new equilibrium one needs to assume some kind of structural model of 
supply and demand. In horizontal mergers it is customary to assume a Bertrand model with
differentiated products, On the demand side a logit model is often used.   
in the first example a simple multinomial logit is presented as simple as possible, so
the use of the Bertrand equation system and the logit demand function will be as 
simple as possible for understanding.   
The second example is a more practical in a sense that the code can be used for several applications
and that the model is a `one level nested logit' which is more realistic.  
also, the simulation procedure in this case is a little longer so the code is wrapped in
functions for different stages of the process.
